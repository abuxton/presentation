# Puppets Tool Set #
## What comes in the box? ##

Puppet comes with solutions for some of the things! I'm going to talk about them in the order you normally encounter them.

* Facter - infrastructure auditing, expandable tooling.
* Puppet - Puppet or the Puppet DSL, resources for inventory and management at the command line.
* MCollective - Management, or command and control. Ability to provide simple reporting and expure for auditing from Facter.
* Console - Exposes the data you do have, shows you reports and log information.
* PuppetAPI - The Puppet API or PuppetDB directly allows you to see all the data exposed.

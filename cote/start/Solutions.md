## What are some solutions or things we all need! ##

Puppet has its own "Chicken and Eggs"! But what do we normally want, what are our eggs . 

* Tooling - Tools to make life easier.
* Auditing - We all need to know things about our infrastructure.
* Reporting and logging - We should all have visability of whats happening.
* Inventory discovery - We all carry tool kits that let us see information about our estate.
* Management - Its not much of a configuration management talk otherwise!

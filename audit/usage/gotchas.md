## Things to bare in mind ##

So if you've not spotted them already I'm going to call them out.

* Duplicate resources, not only allowed but determined to hit them.
* Lots of front load on the requirment, thats right you have to generate the md5, know the desired group, owner and mode etc
* You'll need to comunicate best practice for using them.
* The implimentation could encourage inheritance of the profile o that a resource can be overridden, i'm not sure this is a bad thing?

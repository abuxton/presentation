# Its a little like Minecraft! #
## Stay with me, honest... ##

You've either played or you have not. But every thing in minecraft is leyars of buildings blocks in collections.

* Your mountain is the same components as my mountain.
* Sorry I said mountain, I meant webserver.

So you can tell me how to build your mountain/webserver. We can work out if your right later, and we'll recognise the blocks we need together.

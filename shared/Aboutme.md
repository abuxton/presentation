# Introductions first! 

From a background in scratching  around in the guts of disperate and deprecated systems  both technological and physical. A former lots of things,  project manager,  sytem administrator, university technician, consultant and chef! (The food type).  

A need to support my coffee addiction has taken me around the world working with and supporting all manner of development teams. The same addiction has supported me through long days and nights of platform intergrations, fire fighting and launch management for various development teams in startups, gaming, finance and most fields of enterprise.

Feel free to buy me a coffee and ask my opinion on anything technology, devops, or system architecture and  configuration management.
